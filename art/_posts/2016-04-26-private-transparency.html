The artwork derived from a growing concern for the threshold between privacy and the public in modern day living. Brick and mortar becoming more and more non existant as a safe haven for personal expression and comfort through the sharing of photos online and interactions on social media. It recognises and represents the potential power of information and data that is freely uploaded by the masses.
