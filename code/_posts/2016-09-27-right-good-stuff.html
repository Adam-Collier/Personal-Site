		<p>A web based project which links visual representations to content elsewhere on the internet. The idea was to create a single location where the best art and design content from around the web can be hand picked and shown. The user would be able to quickly see what they are interested in visually and be redirected to the content hosts blog post via a link. The project was designed first then taken online, it can be found <a href ="https://adam-collier.github.io/rightgoodstuff/">here</a> </p>
